        <p>I have a background in economic research,  but I've been doing more freelance front-end dev work as of late. There's not much to see here yet, so come back later.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, here's my <a href="https://github.com/msunji">Github account</a>. Always open to doing more front-end work as well as English-Filipino/Tagalog translations.</p>
